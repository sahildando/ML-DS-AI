Seaborn is a powerful Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics, making it easier to create informative visualizations with less code. Seaborn integrates well with Pandas and works directly with DataFrames, enabling the creation of plots with rich aesthetic features.

Concepts of Seaborn
Aesthetic Defaults: Seaborn comes with better default aesthetics than Matplotlib. It automatically adds grid lines, better color palettes, and neatly spaced axis labels.

Dataset-Oriented Plotting: Seaborn works seamlessly with Pandas data structures (DataFrames). It supports easy mapping of variables (e.g., columns) to visual elements.

Statistical Plots: Seaborn offers many kinds of statistical plots that help in visualizing data distributions, relationships, and categorical variables. It also performs statistical estimation and integrates well with regression modeling.

Color Palettes: Seaborn has color palette functionality that helps in improving the aesthetics of visualizations, including categorical and sequential data.

Figure-Level vs. Axes-Level Functions:

Axes-level: These functions (like sns.boxplot(), sns.scatterplot(), etc.) plot data on a single matplotlib.axes.Axes.
Figure-level: Functions like sns.catplot(), sns.lmplot(), and sns.pairplot() create complex, faceted visualizations that use a Figure and multiple axes.
